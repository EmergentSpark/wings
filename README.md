# Gameplay Details
I'll get to writing this soon.

# Technical Details
* Project configuration files are supplied for Visual Studio 2019. You shouldn't encounter any problems compiling.
* Both Debug and Release versions link against Release library binaries.
* No external resource dependencies.
* Uses OpenGL 1.1 so would gain a considerable performance boost if upgraded to more modern pipeline code.

# About
This is the entire source and project files for a game I developed that is ultimately a culmination of over 16 years of programming experience combined with a few years of game development experience. It came after much trial and error, failing many times, a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, and was what I would've at one point considered my life's work.

I'm well aware that this source is quite valuable, and not only could I have possibly sold it for a lot of money, but I also could've chosen to refine everything and commercialize it to make revenue that way. What I'm saying is that I'm not ceasing any further development on it and choosing to release it as open source to the public out of thinking that it's trash. I know the future prospects for continuing to develop this and eventually trying to commercialize it are quite good; I most likely could've quite easily not only made a living but acquired considerable wealth through continued efforts on it.

I'm choosing to release this source because these future prospects hold absolutely no meaning to me. I have become so thoroughly disillusioned by humanity, and so brutally deprived of any possibility of ever achieving a truly fulfilling happiness in my life, that confusing and scaring people by casually throwing away any and all constructive future prospects for myself in favor of meditating in isolation using quantum energy harvesting meditation strategies to strengthen myself to the point that I can become an extremely brutal and cruel dictator of the world is the only thing that I find any meaning and purpose in, and I feel absolutely unwaveringly driven to do so without the slightest bit of hesitation or doubt.

I don't care who you are, and I don't care whether you know of me or the circumstances of my life that have lead to things ending up how they have for this world or not, but if you're reading this, I want you to know that you're part of the problem regardless, and you will undoubtedly feel the consequences of my solution, sooner or later.

I wrote a ~500 page book explaining in great depth many things, going into considerable detail about the field of philopsychology, which to any reasonably intelligent and unbiased individual, should make it extremely clear as to why I've chosen to release this source. The contents of this book can be found both in the README.html in the project, as well as at http://theblackbook.cc/

The initial version of this book was officially released to the public towards the very end of 2019, and is the reason why the COVID-19 pandemic started very early in the year of 2020. It also landed me criminal charges, a court case, and a 60-day psychological evaluation in a mental hospital. By the time I was done with the doctors evaluating me, they told me they were honored to have met me, greatly appreciated my openness and cooperation in elaborating in such detail about my life and knowledge, wished me the best of luck in achieving the goal I was after, and let me leave without any resistance.

I have failed to achieve that goal, through no lack of mental fortitude and good intentions on my part, and thus have become absolutely certain that I will never desire to be a positive, constructive, good person ever again for the rest of my existence.

I don't give a flying fuck what you do with this source. You're royally fucked anyways, along with the rest of this shitty planet.
